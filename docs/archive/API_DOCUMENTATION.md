|--------|---------|------------|------------------|
| Planning Commission | âœ… Active | Zoning, Variances, Land Use | Weekly |
| City Council | âœ… Ready | Public Projects, Infrastructure | Weekly (configurable) |
| Development Services | ðŸ“‹ Planned | Permits, Private Development | TBD |
| Public Works | ðŸ“‹ Planned | Infrastructure Projects | TBD |

}
```

### Legacy Endpoints

**GET** `/summary.json` - Lightweight summary with recent projects
**GET** `/extracted-*.json` - Legacy format files (deprecated)

## Data Schema

### Project Types

- **`zoning`** - Zoning changes, variances, administrative deviations
- **`private_dev`** - Private development projects, subdivisions, site plans
- **`public_project`** - City-funded projects, public facilities
- **`infrastructure`** - Roads, utilities, transportation projects

### Decision Stages

- **`proposal`** - Initial application/proposal stage
- **`review`** - Under staff or board review
- **`hearing`** - Scheduled for public hearing
- **`approved`** - Approved by decision-making body
- **`denied`** - Denied by decision-making body
- **`deferred`** - Deferred to future meeting
- **`construction`** - Under construction
- **`completed`** - Project completed

### Authority Levels

- **`staff`** - Administrative/staff-level decision
- **`planning`** - Planning Commission authority
- **`council`** - City Council authority
- **`board`** - Other board/commission authority

### Geographic Scope

- **`parcel`** - Single property/parcel
- **`block`** - City block level
- **`neighborhood`** - Neighborhood impact
- **`district`** - Council district wide
- **`citywide`** - City-wide impact
- **`regional`** - Multi-jurisdictional

## Cross-References

The system automatically identifies related projects based on:

- **Same Location** - Projects at identical addresses
- **Geographic Proximity** - Projects within close geographic proximity
- **Sequential** - Related project sequences (phases, companion items)
- **Prerequisite** - Projects that depend on others
- **Related** - General relationship between projects

## Query Capabilities

While the API currently provides full dataset access, the frontend supports:

- **Search** - Full-text search across project titles, locations, descriptions
- **Filtering** - By project type, decision stage, council district, authority level
- **Sorting** - By meeting date, project type, location
- **Geographic** - Map-based visualization when coordinates available

## Data Freshness

- **Planning Commission**: Updated weekly after meetings (Thursdays)
- **Real-time Status**: Check `last_updated` timestamp in response
- **Update Frequency**: Configurable per data source
- **Historical Data**: Maintains historical decisions and status changes

## Rate Limiting

Currently no rate limiting implemented. The static JSON files can be accessed directly.

## Error Handling

Standard HTTP status codes:

- **200** - Success
- **404** - File not found
- **500** - Server error during data processing

## Data Quality

### Validation
- All projects validated against unified schema
- Automatic data type conversion and normalization
- Cross-reference validation between related projects

### Coverage
- **Planning Commission**: 90%+ meeting coverage since 2024
- **Historical Data**: Archives available back to 2019 (via legacy system)
- **Geocoding**: Automatic address geocoding when location provided

## Integration Examples

### JavaScript
```javascript
fetch('/all-projects.json')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log(`${data.total_projects} projects from ${data.sources.length} sources`);
    // Process projects
    data.projects.forEach(project => {
      console.log(`${project.project_id}: ${project.title}`);
    });
  });
```

### Python
```python
import requests

response = requests.get('http://localhost:8000/all-projects.json')
data = response.json()

# Filter by project type
zoning_projects = [p for p in data['projects'] if p['project_type'] == 'zoning']
print(f"Found {len(zoning_projects)} zoning projects")

# Find projects in specific district
district_7 = [p for p in data['projects'] if p['council_district'] == '7']
```

### Command Line
```bash
# Get total project count
curl -s http://localhost:8000/all-projects.json | jq '.total_projects'

# List all project types
curl -s http://localhost:8000/all-projects.json | jq -r '.projects[].project_type' | sort | uniq

# Find projects with related items
curl -s http://localhost:8000/all-projects.json | jq '.projects[] | select(.related_projects | length > 0)'
```
