# JaxWatch Development Roadmap

This roadmap defines three distinct development phases to maintain focus and prevent scope creep.

## Current Phase: Foundation (September 2025)

**Goal**: Establish solid architectural foundation with schema validation and reliable data pipeline

### Completed âœ…
- Unified data schema with Pydantic models
- Municipal observatory orchestrator architecture
- Working adapters for 4 data sources (planning commission, infrastructure, private development, public projects)
- Newspaper-style frontend with feed and map views
- Repository reorganization with clear separation of concerns
- Schema validation guardrails
- Health monitoring system

### In Progress ðŸ”„
- Slack alert system for pipeline failures
- Firestore integration enhancement
- Updated build system for new folder structure

### Remaining Foundation Tasks
- Complete import path updates after reorganization
- Enhanced error handling with structured alerts
- Automated deployment pipeline
- Performance optimization for data processing

### Success Criteria
- All pipelines validate against unified schema
- Zero silent failures (all errors trigger alerts)
- Sub-2-hour update cycles for new documents
- Clean separation between production and experimental code

## Next Phase: Strength (October-November 2025)

**Goal**: Enhance data collection depth and system reliability

### Data Source Expansion
- City Council Legislative Gateway integration (adapter exists, needs activation)
- Additional department data sources (Parks, Utilities, Development Services)
- Historical data backfill for trend analysis
- Cross-departmental project correlation

### Advanced Validation
- Multi-source data verification
- Automated conflict detection between sources
- Enhanced geocoding accuracy
- Data quality scoring system

### System Reliability
- Redundant data collection pathways
- Automated failover mechanisms
- Advanced health monitoring dashboards
- Performance metrics and optimization

### Success Criteria
- 90%+ coverage of major municipal decisions
- Cross-referenced project tracking across departments
- Automated data quality assurance
- 99%+ system uptime

## Future Phase: Growth (2026)

**Goal**: Advanced features and community engagement

### Advanced Analysis
- AI-powered document summarization
- Trend detection and forecasting
- Budget impact analysis
- Community sentiment integration

### Enhanced User Experience
- Advanced map features with overlays
- Mobile application
- Email/SMS notification system
- Community comment and reaction system

### Open Data Platform
- Public API for civic data
- Developer documentation and tools
- Data export capabilities
- Integration with other civic platforms

### Experimental Features
- OCR for scanned documents
- Multi-language support
- Accessibility enhancements
- Advanced search and filtering

### Success Criteria
- Self-sustaining community engagement
- Integration with broader civic tech ecosystem
- Recognition as model for other municipalities
- Measurable impact on civic participation

## Development Guidelines

### Phase Progression Rules
1. No work begins on next phase until current phase success criteria are met
2. Critical bugs in previous phases take priority over new features
3. Each phase must maintain backward compatibility
4. Breaking changes require architectural decision documentation

### Feature Requests
- New features assigned to appropriate phase based on complexity and dependencies
- MVP phase features require exceptional justification
- Experimental features start in /experiments folder before promotion

### Review Schedule
- Monthly roadmap review for current phase progress
- Quarterly cross-phase planning sessions
- Annual strategic roadmap revision

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Data source changes**: Monitor for structural changes, maintain fallback methods
- **Scale limitations**: Performance testing and optimization at each phase
- **Dependency failures**: Minimize external dependencies, graceful degradation

### Operational Risks
- **Maintainer availability**: Documentation and knowledge sharing priority
- **Funding sustainability**: Plan for minimal operational costs
- **Legal/policy changes**: Stay current with public records laws
