Repository Cleanup (September 2025)

Summary
- Removed legacy and generated artifacts that were not referenced by the website or active scripts, to reduce clutter and avoid confusion.
- Focus was on clearly unused files (logs, PIDs, a backup JSON, an unused GeoJSON, and unreferenced test PDFs). No core site or data-processing code was altered.

Removed Files
- jacksonville-districts.geojson — not referenced anywhere; Leaflet district overlays are currently disabled in app.js.
- server.log, server.pid — runtime artifacts from a local server session.
- batch_log.txt, complete_geocoding.log, full_geocoding.log, geocoding_log.txt, geocoding_output.log, geocode_output.txt — temporary logs/outputs from geocoding runs.
- test_report.json — test artifact; generated by tests as needed (see Makefile and test_observatory.py).
- test-download.pdf, test-results-08-21-25.pdf — unreferenced binary test files.
- all-projects_backup.json — superseded by all-projects.json; not referenced by site code.

Notes
- The public website only reads: index.html, styles.css, app.js, project-detail.html, project-detail.js, and all-projects.json. None of the above removals affect those paths.
- Python ETL scripts, tests, and data JSONs remain intact. Many extracted JSON files and PDFs exist for development and provenance; they were left in place.
- Tests still create/delete test_report.json when run; removing the stale file does not affect test behavior.

Recommendations
- Consider keeping logs and run artifacts out of the repo (already covered by .gitignore for *.log), and avoid committing PDFs where feasible (also ignored).
- If district overlays are reintroduced, re-add a districts GeoJSON under a versioned data path (e.g., data/geo/jax-districts.v1.geojson) and wire it up explicitly in app.js.
